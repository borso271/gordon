This can also be a python service...

what this does is if possible with trading view show a chart with multiple tickers in one.
and then a table with their key financial performance over last quarter and last year,
and then it will also explain it to you.

Use the trading view compare chart.

This is easy, make the comparison table.

You can ask gpt to compare two stocks.

Like compare apple and tesla.

Or you can have a list, compare with from which you select the stock.

It would be nice to have a selection of the stock,
- you first check if the symbol is there
- if it is not there you look by name
- if name is also not there, then you do a semantic search among the ones you have?
  or else return false?

Next: 1. Return snapshot
      2. Return data for comparison
      3. Do comparison as the first one

Then:
      4. Add ratings or other keys to list.
      5. Figure out strategies and portfolios and how they work together (important, pro features)
      6. Make immediately shift to a different page
