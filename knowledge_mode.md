Option 1 is that the bot will start a flow in which you can do the quiz...
and you can click: back to chat...
and just presents you with one screen at a time, depending on when you respond

And then you have the button:
- Try again

SUPPOSE THAT YOU CLICK BACK TO CHAT...
Then you might have a button: CONTINUE QUIZ... in which it will now disable input again and let you continue the quiz...

You prepare 10 of them.

questions: [

    {Text: ,
    options: [{
        text:
        right/wrong:

    }],
    Explanation: some_explanation}
]
}

What you do is keep track of these quizzes and send them to the user...
They can alway click of these buttons:
- back to chat
- continue quiz
- retake this quiz

When they finish the quiz, the Bot will say: congratulations... or whatever...



SO YOU HAVE A FUNCTION TO CALL THE QUIZ

This seems fun to try.
