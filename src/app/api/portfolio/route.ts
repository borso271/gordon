4. Portfolio-wise, you might have to build the portfolio generating algorithm...
   depending on the user preferences, you can also ask openai to modify the list, for this see point 5

For example:
you have parameters like:

- Have portfolios with tags...
  And then what about tweaking it, like: give me more technology stocks, or less of this or that...
  
  You might try to do this with a semantic index... actually... in which you have your pool of stocks with tags
  like: undervaluation_score, hypervaluation_score, etc.

  Then you have a preselection, + a semantic search, so you can always change what you are offering the user...

  So portfolio, user parameters.

  Must include: ... ... ... particular tickers the user wants to be included... ... ...
  
  We should probably add specific tags to each stock so that if the user ask for filters and semantic suggestions both are run...

  Like the search is done with: technology and healthcare...

  Suppose the user asks: 40% technology, and 20% healthcare, and something else...
  
  ---

  List of requirements like:
  market_cap
  greater than 20 billions...
  etc.

  Assets allotment: technology:40, healthcase:20... etc.
  with defaults.

  And semantic tags: undervalued, etc...

  That is a possibility. Then you add tags to the stocks, and you return the results.

... ... ...

  Or you actually ask gpt to make a query on the spot to fetch from the database the data it needs.
  
  HAVE GPT give you the paramters...
  and USER PROFILE TOO...

  And based on all these, you select the stocks...

  If you don't arrive to ten, you return less than 10.


You need to add tags to the stock, like trending_score, undervaluation_score...
which you might not have in reality actually, in which case.

Required tickers might be a list of tickers that the user ask gpt to include in the portfolio...
Make an allotment is different though...



---

Option 1: you just have a predefined list of portfolios, and you suggest one of them to the user.
Option 2: you have a portfolio generating algorythm that goes by filters given by gpt plus semantic filtering through tags, which makes sense too.

These are the portfolios I have...

have a list of equities
make allocations (based on what?)

ideally, you can do it from any set of equities, even from the top rated way by analysts.

or you shouls suggest...

MODEL PORTFOLIO is the keyword







suggest famous portfolios...


then you can suggest a strategy on it...


then you can backtest a strategy too...

To make portfolio from what you already have:
Great question. Creating a stock portfolio selector based on user profile (risk + horizon) involves several layers: understanding user input, mapping it to portfolio rules, and filtering stocks accordingly. Let's break this down:

üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Step 1: Understand User Inputs
You‚Äôll need to collect and normalize the following from the user:

üéØ Essential Inputs
Risk Tolerance:

low, medium, high (can also be a number from 1‚Äì10).

Investment Horizon:

short (under 1 year)

medium (1‚Äì5 years)

long (5+ years)

üß© Optional but Powerful Extras
Thematic Interests (e.g., green energy, tech, etc.)

Geography preferences

Dividend preference (income vs growth)

Liquidity needs (can‚Äôt hold illiquid small caps)

üìä Step 2: Stock Data You Should Have
For each of the 500 stocks in your database, you ideally want:

Field	Use
Ticker / Name	Identification
Sector / Industry	Diversification & thematic filters
Market Cap	Risk level (small cap = riskier)
Volatility (e.g. beta)	Risk filtering
Dividend Yield	Income filtering
P/E or Valuation	For value/growth filters
Price trend / momentum	Growth/hype detection
Country/Region	Geographical preference
Liquidity / Avg volume	Important for risk-averse or large portfolios
Historical performance	For backtesting or trend-based filters
ESG score (optional)	For sustainability-conscious investors
üß† Step 3: Filtering Logic
üõ° Risk Mapping
Risk Tolerance	Target Stocks
Low	Large-cap, low beta (< 1), high dividend, stable sectors (utilities, healthcare)
Medium	Mix of large/mid caps, moderate beta (< 1.2), growth + dividend
High	Mid/small-cap, high beta (> 1.3), momentum, emerging sectors (AI, biotech)
‚è≥ Horizon Mapping
Horizon	Target Traits
Short	Low volatility, liquidity, dividend-paying
Medium	Stable growth, moderate risk
Long	High growth, can handle volatility, lower liquidity OK
You can mix these two into a scoring function or rule-based filter.

üßÆ Step 4: Scoring or Selection
Create a scoring algorithm that gives weights to each feature based on the user profile. Example:

python
Copy
Edit
def score_stock(stock, user_profile):
    score = 0
    
    # Risk profile adjustment
    if user_profile['risk'] == 'low':
        if stock['beta'] < 1: score += 2
        if stock['dividend_yield'] > 2: score += 2
        if stock['market_cap'] > 10_000_000_000: score += 2
    elif user_profile['risk'] == 'high':
        if stock['beta'] > 1.3: score += 2
        if stock['sector'] in ['Tech', 'Biotech']: score += 2
        if stock['market_cap'] < 2_000_000_000: score += 2
    
    # Investment horizon
    if user_profile['horizon'] == 'short':
        if stock['volatility'] < 0.2: score += 2
        if stock['liquidity'] > 1_000_000: score += 1
    elif user_profile['horizon'] == 'long':
        if stock['price_growth_5y'] > 0.5: score += 2
        if stock['dividend_yield'] < 2: score += 1

    return score
Then pick the top N stocks by score.

üß∞ Step 5: Portfolio Construction
Filter top scoring stocks.

Ensure diversification: group by sector, geography, etc.

Optionally run mean-variance optimization (e.g., Modern Portfolio Theory) if you have historical return/volatility/covariance.

üß† Bonus: Learning from Feedback
Store past user picks and outcomes.

Use this to train a model that learns ideal portfolios for each profile over time.

Would you like help building a starter scoring function, or wiring this into an API/React app?
