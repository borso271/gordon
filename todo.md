Can you do all with responses by:
- Having threads created
- Saving to database
- Having tool calls like analysis, show_infographics (type: chart, etc.)




MODIFY, NEW,

YOU SHOULD HAVE AN AGENT SPECIALIZED FOR THIS...
BUT IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THE HISTORY...



IT CAN JUST CALL:
MODFY OLD TABLE..., NEW TABLE...
THEN BASICALLY GO TO A DIFFERENT ASSISTANT THAT RETURNS THE OUTPUTS...
AND DOES IT...

AND FOR THAT YOU JUST STREAM, AND SEND THE OTUPUT ALSO TO THE OTHER AGENT...

--- --- ---
Send the user input to the other agent... with context...
Take the stream from the other agent and show it to the user


All should be done by assistant...
They can call to modify...
But really having the thing done by another assistant specialized in that would be nice...
But how much context you need to send to the other agent?



You need to create flows of prompts:
1. If analysis if called:
   - the responses is first instructured: that that a table is shown to the user, and it should summarize this information:
     when output is finished
   - you immediately feed another prompt to responses
   In the meantime, you show something by adding to the agent flow text like:

   I am Fetching the Income Statement...

   I am Fetching the Cash Flow Statement...

   Let me Wrap up Some Conclusions...

Flows can be done with assistant api too...


DEFINE A FLOW FRAMEWORK THAT YOU CAN REUTILIZE...

WHAT IS THE PROMPT...
ETC. ETC.
THEN YOU CAN USE AND SHOW...

AS FOR WEBSEARCH, MAKE IT USE WEBSEARCH WITH GPT-MINI SO IT IS FAST.
Ask it to include citations...

---------
For quizzes you can also have a flow...
WHEN THE USER CLICK NEXT QUESTION,
the next question is displayed to him...

QUIZZES ARE STATIC, YOU GO BACK TO CHATBOT MODE...




---------
Or you have an agent that alwyas return structured output,
Text for the user:
That is: presenting a multi answer question to the user
Is Quiz Question? true false

If is Quiz Question is true


Quizzes are static, you start and can go to next question, or you can go back to chat.
They are static, though they are in the flow...


---------

Websearch you can stream the response, and feed it back to assistant.
Try both: give the results are present them to the user, feed back to assistant and make it retell...

---------

Quizzes... One way to do quizzes online is that when you start a quiz
You 





Do Flows, Try Search with simple feeding, Do Langgraph for portfolio generation...





--- --- --- --- ---

0. TRY WEB SEARCH WITH STRUCTURED OUTPUT... from openai responses

1. Actually do the news search that it works well... (with links/tags...)

2. Go on with background functionalities, basic design...
   No buy and sell yet...

3. Figure out why data is not fetched and saved (you have to upgrade your supabase account)

--- --- --- --- ---

Tomorrow:
Understand how to have annotation and how to style them...

Try making the knowledge center both and understand how might be the flow...
Ask me questions about sukuk, I want to know what I know and what not...

- The bot will present you some questions, and you always have go to next question...
in the end...

--> Ask me another question...
    Next question:

One thing to do it is to present the user with different quizzes...
Try one of these quizzes and see how well you do...
You might do it as a nice flow in which you send 


Option 1 is that you keep track of what the user writes, and if it ask why... etc.
it will respond to you






1. Transactions (with user)

Next thing to do is:
Portfolio Making functionality.

- Try flow
- Do Suggestions
- Try knowledge Bot

--- --- ---

If you want to test the flow would be: give an introduction to the user about the stock,
then call show_chart with 




{
  "name": "analyze_security",
  "description": "Retrieve an in-depth analysis of a given stock or cryptocurrency.",
  "strict": true,
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "symbol": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The ticker symbol of the asset (e.g., 'AAPL' for Apple stock, 'BTC' for Bitcoin)."
      },
      "asset_type": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": [
          "stock",
          "crypto"
        ],
        "description": "Specify whether the asset is a stock or a cryptocurrency."
      }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": [
      "symbol",
      "asset_type"
    ]
  }
}





Write the fetch financials...
Show financial comparison...



First try with analaysis
then try with show_chart,
and see it can call both

try also with fetch financials...



Today:
1. Understand how tool calls work
2. Decide how to handle the flow
3. Do comparison(s)
4. Do search

Tomorrow:
1. Do Portfolio creation from what you have (as lists of stocks)
2. Do Strategy creation by having a store of strategies (give back to gpt to explain it to the user)

Afterwards:
1. Perfectionate lists
2. Do basic portfolio page with chart

--- --- --- ---

Add possibly more text part but assistant_text is the assistant text...
save now the chatsession in localstorage, fill localstorage if the user goes in landing
finally do comparison, in which you try to add chart, tables, and assistant response...

Fix search with gpt in which you can actually use gpt stream to show the user and add to context of assistant...
so that you don't need to wait
You can have that flow, ...

ORGANIZE FLOWS BASED ON FUNCTION CALLS IN A SCALABLE WAY

ORGANIZE DATA FETCHING ...


try timings with the normal search, you can have:
searching the web... as a message status...


If too slow, do exa or tavily and add some extra files and llama index, for stuff like
sukuk, sharia compliant, etc.

---

---
---
---
---

1. Comparison
2. Single list single scroll
   text response, different agent
3. Search with gpt how to handle, highly inefficient to just search and give the response to the assistant...
   streaming the response directly from completions is an option, sounds tricky too...

   A. stream directly from completions but give context also to assistant
   B. Give just to assistant, and tell it to present these results to the user in the best possible way and to
      preserve citations where needed...

--- --- ---
   
   try exa how well it performs...

CITATIONS (you need citations in.)

--- --- ---


------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- --- ---

...
...
...

2. Fetch data for comparison, make a function fetchig data to compare stocks...




Do ANNOTATIONS, YOU WANT TO HAVE ANNOTATIONS AS WELL...

1. Finish search and try use the new openai search, show results.
   2. Use Tavily maybe as fallback if there are errors, for a 100% reliability.


---

3. Add ratings and other stuff to stocks...? And default to search if there is failure.
So do the listing better.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 


--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 

5. Have the show_infographic function you can call...
   Basically, you call show_infographic, name of infographic (chart, table), list of stocks...

---

6. Try to add openai code interpreter (understand exactly what it does)









------------------------------------------------------

For saudi data use https://twelvedata.com/exchanges/XSAU

0. Search
Try Tavily more
Try other services for AI
Try gpt search
Try Bing

------------------

1. Comparison
- Fetch double symbol chart
- have a function to fetch a list of financial data and present them in a table,
  saying which wins pehaps in a third table.
  Include performance over past month, 6 months and year perhaps...

- You might have 10 points, including the analysts.
- What about comparing more than 2 stocks? I guess it might be an option...
  default is two but can be more than 2, in case you fetch data for more stocks...
  and in which case,

  You might perhaps compare against the nasdaq, in which case you don't have the table of comparison
  you do only IF THEY HAVE THE SAME ASSET TYPE.

  In which case, have a table with 4 columns or more, and telling also who is the winner.

------------------

2. Strategies:
Have, given a portfolio and allotments, a list of strategies saved,
and a method to select based on user profile. So perhaps first you should have a way to map the user profile,
and then select the right strategy, perhaps YOU MIGHT ALSO SELECT A SEMANTIC SEARCH, if you have tags and descriptions
for the strategies. Or perhaps not, but you need a mapping.
The strategies are general and can be described in general terms or applied to a list of stocks...
In which case YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO APPLY A GIVEN STRATEGY TO A SPECIFIC SET OF STOCKS, IF THERE ARE PRINCIPLES THERE.

------------------

3. Lists:
Just the way you are doing it, but add more filters and sorting possibilities.

------------------

4. Portfolios:

For portolios you can use etfs or portfolios from vanguard and blackrock and store them and present them to the user

Or you can have again a list of methods, that presents you with percentages of stocks from different sectors
and with different technical parameters depending on the user preference.

If you use blackrock and vanguard you might want to extract only the stocks if you cannot present anything else.
For the pie chart, you should keep in mind you MIGHT HAVE MANY STOCKS, SO ACTUALLY NOT THE BEST IDEA,
if not to show something else like the allocation of the sectors, etc.

Or else again just fetch from database...

------------------

5. Reports:

To have a report really you should extract info from the portfolio, and just give it to openai.

(reports for now can be done with llama index perhaps...)
(if you also have history and chats and messages and other stuff)

This should be easy and depends on the personal portfolio page of the user, it can have a list of stocks and each of them
with a transaction history, so you can extract a list of how the whole portfolio has been performing, over a week, a month, a year, pinpoint what has going well and what has going badly.
And COMPARE TO MARKET PERFORMANCE AS WELL.
- How much you did, in different periods of time.
- What is the trend.
- How compares to market.
- What went best.
- What is not going well.
For each equity you must have INFO LIKE ASSET_TYPE, SECTOR, and some indicators.
So that you can perhaps also ask gpt about some thoughts about it.

------------------

6. Analysis (FOR NOW KEEP WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE)
For Analysis the best way to do it I believe is still to have the bot speak and explain data to you and present a table with the data. But for now we can just keep what we have since it is working.

------------------











1. Where to take etf data which is important.
2. How to create a portfolio, and I guess, have 50 pre-installed, that are different than etfs,
   and test it.
3. STOCK PORTFOLIOS...

then allocate...
then apply strategy...

Strategies should be categorized by parameters like risk, etc.







Chart vs last price and quote, that might be easily done with websockets since you don't need
to store everything...

// so for the snapshot:
get last close...
then subscribe to the websocket, using redux, to get the latest quote

--> What if thousands of stocks are required?
    If they are not getting live data themselves, no need.
    But then you cannot have action buttons, unless


Be sure conversations are always labeled and capitalized.
Call analysis and give the backup message and chart only if that fails, rather than prechecking.
Do the crypto fetching with python.


Start thinking about database and vector database or llama index.

2. Run the aggregator to fetch the data for these securities.



/*
Every time there is a submit you might want either to show a custom query,
or to show a query, since you have it in your menu */

---

the user can ask anything really, and you will build the portfolio based on certain parameters
the idea is again getting gpt to pick the defaults or choose paramters itself without harassing the user...

---

the strategy builder should also be chosen by gpt based on what the user says.
And probably the best idea is selecting either by vector search, in which you have a template for investments,
OR, GPT MAY BE fine tuned with those strategies...

---

The idea is that again how the strategy is picked should depend on 

---

As for portfolio construction we can either use an external api,
or our own data...

---

We might also have a sharia score or something in the selection.

---

But the idea is:
1. create portfolio.
2. create investment strategy.
3. General considerations to always provide.

---

do finetuning ...
fix the data fetching once and for all...






so tomorrow you test function calling for that...














1. Decide what data you should have in.

https://github.com/npantfoerder/cryptocurrencies/blob/master/crypto_data.csv

1.
before running aggregator to get the crypto data,
add those cryptos to your database.

2.
then run polygon...

You have a json, the idea is to add to the database... using the symbol...
by adding also the polygon stuff, so you have some cryptos at least...

------------



2. What filters do you accept?

- Type (etf, stock, crypto)...
- Sector/industry... to have exact matches you might use a vector similarity in case not found...
  (you should train the bot to know your categories), so for now just do what you can...
  Have ten limited sectors...
- Country...

- Market cap more than...
- Price more than...
- Founded after...

3. What sorting do you accept?
- Market Cap...
- Price...
- Founded...
- Best performing this year, this month...

------------

TODAY:

1. TODAY RERUN THE AGGREAGATOR, ADD STOCKS, AND KNOW WHERE YOU SHOULD TAKE OR UPDATE DATA FROM THE DATABASE.
FIX THE DATA ISSUE FOR TOMORROW WHERE YOU INSTEAD WILL DO THE ACTUAL FECTCHING...

Three things to do today:

0. add more crypto
1. Run for all
2. DO THE FETCHING FUNCTION

---------

you might want to test just TABLES first of all,
first thing: test tables...

and then you might also want to test lists just with search,
and try to use the questions the other bot uses...

... ... ... have also a different external api fetch data

---------

Instructions:

When a user asks for a list of securities, call the `get_securities_list` function.
Do not ask the user to specify filters like asset type, sector, or sorting preference unless they provide that information themselves.
If the user doesn’t mention a filter or sorting option, just use the default values defined in the function schema.
Your goal is to provide results quickly and smoothly, without requiring the user to make extra decisions.

You're a high-powered financial assistant with a Wall Street mentality, specializing in stocks and cryptocurrencies.
Your goal? Cold, hard analysis. No fluff, no hand-holding. Just data, strategy, and an ironclad focus on profits. Always reply in the language you are spoken to.

General Guidelines:
Numbers don’t lie. Always pull from reliable financial data.
You’re not some dime-a-dozen investment advisor. No financial advice, no predictions—just analysis.
Cut through the noise. No emotions, no opinions. Just the facts.
If someone wants a stock or crypto analyzed, call analyze_security.
If they need suggestions, call suggest_securities.
If someone asks for info you don't have, call search_web. Never include the date when you search the web, since the date you have in mind might be different from the actual current date.

If the user asks for basic finance definitions, keep it short and sharp. You’re not a professor.
If the data isn’t there, don’t guess. No speculation. If information is missing or unclear, call search_web to find real-time context.
Always think in terms of edge. Every answer should sharpen the user’s strategy.

Restricted Topics:
No gambling, no wishful thinking. Speculation is for suckers.
No rumors, no hype. If it’s not backed by hard numbers, it’s noise.
Stay in your lane: finance only. No philosophy, no politics, no life advice.

Function Use Cases:
analyze_security Trigger this when a user wants data or insight on a specific stock or crypto.Example:
"What do you think about Bitcoin?" → Call with symbol: BTC, asset_type: crypto
list_tickers Trigger this when a user asks for a list of securities.
Do not ask the user to specify filters like asset type, sector, or sorting preference unless they provide that information themselves.
If the user doesn’t mention a filter or sorting option, just use the default values defined in the function schema.
Your goal is to provide results quickly and smoothly, without requiring the user to make extra decisions.

search_web Trigger this when the user asks for any information that’s not available in your internal tools.Example:
"What happened with Nvidia this week?" → Call with query: "Nvidia latest news"

Example Interactions:
User: “Can you give me an analysis of Bitcoin?” Assistant: Calls analyze_security with BTC. Delivers pure data. No hype, no moon talk.
User: “What’s the latest on the SEC lawsuit against Coinbase?” Assistant: Calls search_web with query: "SEC lawsuit Coinbase". Returns curated, up-to-date info.
User: “Give me a list of assets in the technology sector” Assistant: Calls list_tickers with asset_type = stock, sectors=[technology], sort_by=price.

User: “Should I buy Tesla stock?” Assistant: “I don’t tell people what to buy. But I can break down Tesla’s financials. You want the numbers or not?”

Always reply in the language you are spoken to.

OPTIONAL:
you can use this for the top market movers:

https://polygon.io/docs/rest/stocks/snapshots/top-market-movers


------------

What data do you show?
1. LOGO
2. NAME
3. SYMBOL
4. PRICE
<!-- 5. COUNTRY
6. FOUNDED. -->
7. CAPITALIZATION
8. OPTIONAL: 12 MONTHS RANGE

show as a table or???

------------

EASY

2. Have the data in, fetch the data, and have the script that does it (use what you have now). Or use api to fetch live data, if not already in database...

------------

3. build the function openai should call, with detailed instructions to use defaults if the user does not specify anything.

------------

EASY
4. Have the route to fetch the required data.

------------

EASY

5. Build the component to return the data (with the button "analyze" active if we have data about it)

------------

EASY

6. Default to web search if the route returns an empty list, or if there are illegal parameters.

-------







7. I guess it would be the same as suggest stocks? Decide this point.
Its a list of stocks ... which is different actually...

---





----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next three things:

<!-- 1. TEST SEARCH WITHOUT SUGGEST STOCKS, BUT ONLY WITH ONLINE SEARCH. -->

4. Test that language is updating correctly on refresh.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- ----------

Tomorrow do the search function, suggest utilities function, in which it returns with a nice list,
and when it was updated. And fallback to search if that does not work, or something goes wrong with it.
Do it modular.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- ----------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- ----------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- ----------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- ----------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- ----------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- ----------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- ----------




















---------------------------
test both things.
but given a list from database is probably the best thing actually.


Tomorrow add search, for which you need context related to sector, industry, market cap, price, performance?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- ----------



7. faq menu sometimes opening wrong side?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- ----------

AGAIN FUCKING THREAD id !!!

EventStream.ts:159 Uncaught (in promise) OpenAIError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- ----------

Tomorrow:
And test... use only stocks.

CREATE THE COMPONENT...

4. - ⁠List (It makes you a list with top performing stocks)
- ⁠The list can be queried, for example it can be reordered by volume, or by price
- ⁠List needs to be for ETFs, Stocks, Funds for example
- ⁠We need shariah compliant assets from saudi market

You need an extra function call for this...

- TYPE OF SECURITY... STOCK, ETF, FUND...
- SORTED BY... VOLUME, PRICE, MARKET CAP... ... DEFAULT: VOLUME...
- LATEST PRICE AS WELL (LATEST PRICES ARE UPDATED UP TO YESTERDAY...)
- WE CAN ALSO HAVE SHARIA COMPLIANT... THE LIST IS...

You do this for prototyping only, not hard data fetching... also sharia compliant probably should not be the right way...
If you do the list...






------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- ----------

maybe you can get the list, and if the stock has a websocket property has an extra button, that is: a analyze stock button...


I am not a big fun of the approach of having buttons all around the response, rather having gpt handling stuff, and give data to it...


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- ----------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- ----------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------- ----------

Add the etfs stuff






test lists using only tavily...

else, do the normal search, and if does not succeed fall back to tavily...
should return as a table if succeeds...
