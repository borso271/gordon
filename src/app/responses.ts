Create a thread id,
have always the thread id saved with the messages

Send the latest 5 messages for context.
Have for specific messages the metadata... which you might send...


Based on this chat History, return ... portfolio requests...
... Etc.

You might build a specialized agent for portfolio requests...
Or use the same one (try if it is efficient)


Just keep track of the THREAD, SAVE MESSAGES, and keep track of history.
That's all...
